# Inverted_Pendulum

Controllability and Observability of the system./n
Determining the gain if the system has state-feedback based on a time costraint to stabalize.
Gain margin - point where the LTI system loses its asymptotic stability.
Designing a state-feedback and output-feedback system which follows a constant and variable command.
